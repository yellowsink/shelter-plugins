No Devtools Detection: https://yellowsink.github.io/shelter-plugins/no-devtools-detect
 - Also useful for people who use vertical tabs extensions.
   Without, if the difference between the outer and inner width or height is 160px or more,
   then Discord will think you opened the devtools on web.
 - Prevents the annoying "Wait" and "Hold Up" logs
 - Prevents you from being logged out of your session if you reload with the devtools open,
   or if you use a browser with vertical tabs, being logged out every single session!
